# The One True ~~Morty~~ Monorepo

Example Bazel-ified monorepo, supporting Java, Scala + Python. 

I use this project to explore how Bazel works with different languages and
developer tools, and keep a record of best-practices I've learnt.
Others can use it to check out the Bazel way of doing things and use parts
as a reference implementation.
